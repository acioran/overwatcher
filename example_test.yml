     serial only: True #This needs a serial connection via ser2net or via a terminal server

#First thing we need to define: MARKERS
#If the string is not here, overwatcher does not pay attention to it
#
#Format: <actual string seen from device> : <choose a simple label>
#NOTE: Order of markers is not important
 markers:
    "U-Boot SPL"            :   uboot_begin
    "Hit any key to stop"   :   uboot_enter
    "nn#"                   :   uboot_prompt

#Next we should define: PROMPTS
#These are strings that are expected after a command is sent to the device.
#
#Format: list of markers from above that can appear after running commands
#WARNING: keep the "-" format, it is required to automatically get a list
 prompts:
    - uboot_prompt

#Now we are moving to doing stuff: TRIGGERS
#Automatic actions run when seeing certain markers
#
#Format: <label for marker from above> : <list of stuff to do>
#WARNING: keep the [] format, it is required to automatically get a list
 triggers:
     uboot_begin :  [ WATCH_STATES, TRIGGER_START ]
     uboot_enter :  [ "" ]

#And now the actual test stuff: ACTIONS
#Sequence of commands that need to be added to the test routing below.
#NOTE: the names do not collide with the markers above, but for clarity do not use the same!
#
#Format: <label that you come up with> : <list of stuff to do>
#WARNING: keep the [] format, it is required to automatically get a list
 actions:
     print_stuff:   [ help, printenv ]
     reboot     :   [ IGNORE_STATES, TRIGGER_STOP, reset ]


#Ok, we are almost ready for the test, but first: INITIAL CONFIGURATION
#Run only once when starting the test. TIMEOUT IN EFFECT!
#
#Format: list of markers and/or actions
#WARNING: keep the "-" format, it is required to automatically get a list
 initconfig:
     - uboot_prompt

#Now to the thing we came here for: ZA TEST
#The actual test routing. TIMEOUT IS IN EFFECT!
#
#Format: list of markers, actions and options
#WARNING: keep the "-" format, it is required to automatically get a list
 test:
     - print_stuff
     - SLEEP_RANDOM
     - reboot
     - uboot_enter

#If you are here, you need some advanced tweaks for the test: OPTIONS
#
#Format: <option name>:     <value>
 options:
    timeout     :   150     #seconds
    infiniteTest:   True    #run the test in a loop
    sleep_min   :   20      #seconds
    sleep_max   :   40      #seconds
